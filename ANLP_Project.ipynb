They progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League thanks to a 2-0 win in the first leg, but Tuesday night was supposed to be easy. On Sunday, their place at the top of La Liga was swiped from underneath them, and 92% of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach, according to a recent poll in\\u00a0AS. Most players have been criticised - Cristiano Ronaldo included - but perhaps most under-fire is Iker Casillas. Mr Real Madrid, with over 500 appearances. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at Real Madrid . Three of Schalke's four goals could have been saved, they said. Casillas needs to leave, they said. At 33 years of age, he may well be past his best, with three European Cups, five league titles and one World Cup tucked safely under his belt. Manchester United's David De Gea has been touted as his possible replacement, and even\\u00a0Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher waded into the debate on Tuesday night. 'Madrid need a new keeper. De Gea wants to win trophies. No brainer,' he wrote on Twitter. De Gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by Roy Keane this week, and may leave United . Keylor Navas is also waiting for his chance at the Bernabeu after joining in the summer . And perhaps he has a point. Manchester United have fallen short of expectations once more, and De Gea will be keen to taste success... where better than the city he was born? He is a Spain international, and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman. But you get the feeling that Real Madrid would not be the same without Casillas. Since 1999, he has been a main-stay at the Bernabeu. At the end of the game on Tuesday night, there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team-mates leave the pitch before thanking the Madrid fans. Casillas would not let his team-mates leave the pitch on Tuesday night before they thanked the supporters . Cristiano Ronaldo was unhappy at his side's performance, but was made to applaud the fans by Casillas . Pointing and pulling, ushering his team-mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters. But still they want rid. For the first goal, he palmed the ball into his bottom corner. For the second, he pushed it into the path of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. For the third, he was rooted to the spot. Success is in Madrid's nature, and their fans aren't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding. That starts at the back... with Casillas. Aside from De Gea's potential arrival, you can't forget the presence of Keylor Navas. Signed from Levante in the summer, he is waiting, willing, wishing for his chance. De Gea is a Spain international and grew up in Madrid, playing for Atletico before moving to Man United . Casillas has had a remarkable career, winning numerous trophies including the 2010 World Cup . But De Gea makes sense. He is 24 years old, and getting better with every game he plays. Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for just shy of \\u00a319million in 2011, United would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave. 'I think David De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment,' Roy Keane told ITV after Monday night's FA Cup clash with Arsenal. The best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world. Maybe Jamie Carragher has called it right again.\",\n          \"With their adorable big round eyes and fluffy white fur, these baby seals are cute enough to melt any heart. The harp seals, aged between two and 10-days-old, roll around in the snow and explore their new surroundings. The adorable scene was captured in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts. Snow cute: With their adorable big round eyes and fluffy white fur, these baby seals are cute enough to melt any heart . Brrrilliant: The harp seals, aged between two and 10-days-old, roll around in the snow and explore their new surroundings . Heart-warming: The images were taken by\\u00a0in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts . The 44-year-old spent three days with the seals when she visited a breeding site earlier this month. Cuylaerts, of Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, says: 'It's truly beautiful to watch the little ones get all cosy on the ice. 'They shuffle around, rest, and start squealing when feeding time comes and they're hungry. 'To be there, in the middle of their habitat, was a really great experience. 'The pups basically fill their days with sleeping, eating and getting fat. They spend their first 12 days feeding on very high fat milk from their mothers.' Photographer Ellen Cuylaerts said: 'It's truly beautiful to watch the little ones get all cosy on the ice' 'The pups basically fill their days with sleeping, eating and getting fat,' said Cuylaerts . Cuylaerts, who visited the seals with her husband Michael, watched as the newborns' coats lost there yellow hue and turned completely white . Cuylaerts said that the biggest threat against the seal population is humans . Having gained the trust of the seals, Cuylaerts was able to get within one metre of the pups by lying flat on her stomach and shuffling slowly towards them. Cuylaerts, who visited the seals with her husband Michael, watched as the newborns' coats lost there yellow hue and turned completely white and fluffy over the course of two days. The fur of the harp seal, a species native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean, is a highly valued commodity, and animal rights groups continue to campaign against hunters who target seals.

Cuylaerts was able to get within one metre of the pups by lying flat on her stomach and shuffling slowly towards them . Animal rights groups continue to campaign against hunters who target seals . Loll: The seals love resting on their backs in their icy home . Bliss: This seal looks totally content as it basks in the sun . Adorable: This seal fixes Cuylaerts with its big brown eyes . Cuylaerts says: 'For the harp seal, the biggest threat against their population is humans as the clubbing of seals is still happening. 'When the pups are aged between one and twelve-days old, they cannot be killed but, after the seal's fur starts to molt, the hunt is on. 'The seals are defenceless, not able to swim away or get away! It is cruel and unnecessary.'\",\n          \"Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters. And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (\\u00a31.74million). The Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Hook and Snow White, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper. Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Calgary, British Columbia, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million . Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago . Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods . Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears . The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements. They'll also be the proud holder of British Columbia's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky. And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Calgary, 275 miles away. However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea, \\u00a0the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake. Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of British Columbia, soaring 50 feet into the sky . Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Doris Needham . Enchanting: Doris was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest . For sale: It was bought in 1990 by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers, who have now decided it is time to retire . Continue: But Rocky has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction . The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Doris and Ernest Needham, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House. Indeed, it was Doris' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in the Cedar Mountains. Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by\\u00a0Rocky and Juliet Ehlers. The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement. Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world . Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year . Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world . Rocky, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review: \\u00a0'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.' He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. Estate agent Steve Daschuk said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Canada and internationally. 'We've even had people get in touch from China, enquiring about the forest.' And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year. It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Manhattan, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central London and Hong Kong. Dragons: Estate agent\\u00a0Steve Daschuk described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from China had expressed interest . Remote: The nearest large town is Calgary - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9962,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ireland's iconic captain Paul O'Connell wins his 100th cap against Wales .\\nA lot has changed since the Munster man made his debut in 2002 .\\nBut Wales\\u00a0scrum-half Rhys Webb has plan to ruin the big day .\\nWebb says he did not agree with way England approached Ireland game .\",\n          \"Labour launched poster claiming the NHS faced a 'Tory cuts plan'\\nThe advert featured an x-ray showing a broken leg of a suspected toddler .\\nMedical experts say it also shows other older injuries to leg and ankle .\\nAppears 'very likely non-accidental injury' and could be result of abuse .\",\n          \"John Watson,  former McLaren driver, was alarmed by race in Melbourne .\\nHe believes the FIA and CVC need to sit down and\\u00a0discuss\\u00a0direction\\u00a0of F1 .\\nOnly 15 cars started the season-opening Australian Grand Prix .\\nWatson fears fans and sponsors are turned off by Mercedes domination .\\nBut he expects McLaren and Honda to recover from difficult starts .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League thanks to a 2-0 win in the first leg, but Tuesday night was supposed to be easy. On Sunday, their place at the top of La Liga was swiped from underneath them, and 92% of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach, according to a recent poll in\\u00a0AS. Most players have been criticised - Cristiano Ronaldo included - but perhaps most under-fire is Iker Casillas. Mr Real Madrid, with over 500 appearances. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at Real Madrid . Three of Schalke's four goals could have been saved, they said. Casillas needs to leave, they said. At 33 years of age, he may well be past his best, with three European Cups, five league titles and one World Cup tucked safely under his belt. Manchester United's David De Gea has been touted as his possible replacement, and even\\u00a0Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher waded into the debate on Tuesday night. 'Madrid need a new keeper. De Gea wants to win trophies. No brainer,' he wrote on Twitter. De Gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by Roy Keane this week, and may leave United . Keylor Navas is also waiting for his chance at the Bernabeu after joining in the summer . And perhaps he has a point. Manchester United have fallen short of expectations once more, and De Gea will be keen to taste success... where better than the city he was born? He is a Spain international, and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman. But you get the feeling that Real Madrid would not be the same without Casillas. Since 1999, he has been a main-stay at the Bernabeu. At the end of the game on Tuesday night, there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team-mates leave the pitch before thanking the Madrid fans. Casillas would not let his team-mates leave the pitch on Tuesday night before they thanked the supporters . Cristiano Ronaldo was unhappy at his side's performance, but was made to applaud the fans by Casillas . Pointing and pulling, ushering his team-mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters. But still they want rid. For the first goal, he palmed the ball into his bottom corner. For the second, he pushed it into the path of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. For the third, he was rooted to the spot. Success is in Madrid's nature, and their fans aren't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding. That starts at the back... with Casillas. Aside from De Gea's potential arrival, you can't forget the presence of Keylor Navas. Signed from Levante in the summer, he is waiting, willing, wishing for his chance. De Gea is a Spain international and grew up in Madrid, playing for Atletico before moving to Man United . Casillas has had a remarkable career, winning numerous trophies including the 2010 World Cup . But De Gea makes sense. He is 24 years old, and getting better with every game he plays. Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for just shy of \\u00a319million in 2011, United would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave. 'I think David De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment,' Roy Keane told ITV after Monday night's FA Cup clash with Arsenal. The best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world. Maybe Jamie Carragher has called it right again.\",\n          \"With their adorable big round eyes and fluffy white fur, these baby seals are cute enough to melt any heart. The harp seals, aged between two and 10-days-old, roll around in the snow and explore their new surroundings. The adorable scene was captured in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts. Snow cute: With their adorable big round eyes and fluffy white fur, these baby seals are cute enough to melt any heart . Brrrilliant: The harp seals, aged between two and 10-days-old, roll around in the snow and explore their new surroundings . Heart-warming: The images were taken by\\u00a0in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts . The 44-year-old spent three days with the seals when she visited a breeding site earlier this month. Cuylaerts, of Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, says: 'It's truly beautiful to watch the little ones get all cosy on the ice. 'They shuffle around, rest, and start squealing when feeding time comes and they're hungry. 'To be there, in the middle of their habitat, was a really great experience. 'The pups basically fill their days with sleeping, eating and getting fat. They spend their first 12 days feeding on very high fat milk from their mothers.' Photographer Ellen Cuylaerts said: 'It's truly beautiful to watch the little ones get all cosy on the ice' 'The pups basically fill their days with sleeping, eating and getting fat,' said Cuylaerts . Cuylaerts, who visited the seals with her husband Michael, watched as the newborns' coats lost there yellow hue and turned completely white . Cuylaerts said that the biggest threat against the seal population is humans . Having gained the trust of the seals, Cuylaerts was able to get within one metre of the pups by lying flat on her stomach and shuffling slowly towards them. Cuylaerts, who visited the seals with her husband Michael, watched as the newborns' coats lost there yellow hue and turned completely white and fluffy over the course of two days. The fur of the harp seal, a species native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean, is a highly valued commodity, and animal rights groups continue to campaign against hunters who target seals.

Cuylaerts was able to get within one metre of the pups by lying flat on her stomach and shuffling slowly towards them . Animal rights groups continue to campaign against hunters who target seals . Loll: The seals love resting on their backs in their icy home . Bliss: This seal looks totally content as it basks in the sun . Adorable: This seal fixes Cuylaerts with its big brown eyes . Cuylaerts says: 'For the harp seal, the biggest threat against their population is humans as the clubbing of seals is still happening. 'When the pups are aged between one and twelve-days old, they cannot be killed but, after the seal's fur starts to molt, the hunt is on. 'The seals are defenceless, not able to swim away or get away! It is cruel and unnecessary.'\",\n          \"Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters. And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (\\u00a31.74million). The Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Hook and Snow White, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper. Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Calgary, British Columbia, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million . Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago . Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods . Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears . The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements. They'll also be the proud holder of British Columbia's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky. And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Calgary, 275 miles away. However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea, \\u00a0the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake. Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of British Columbia, soaring 50 feet into the sky . Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Doris Needham . Enchanting: Doris was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest . For sale: It was bought in 1990 by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers, who have now decided it is time to retire . Continue: But Rocky has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction . The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Doris and Ernest Needham, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House. Indeed, it was Doris' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in the Cedar Mountains. Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by\\u00a0Rocky and Juliet Ehlers. The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement. Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world . Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year . Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world . Rocky, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review: \\u00a0'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.' He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. Estate agent Steve Daschuk said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Canada and internationally. 'We've even had people get in touch from China, enquiring about the forest.' And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year. It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Manhattan, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central London and Hong Kong. Dragons: Estate agent\\u00a0Steve Daschuk described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from China had expressed interest . Remote: The nearest large town is Calgary - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9962,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ireland's iconic captain Paul O'Connell wins his 100th cap against Wales .\\nA lot has changed since the Munster man made his debut in 2002 .\\nBut Wales\\u00a0scrum-half Rhys Webb has plan to ruin the big day .\\nWebb says he did not agree with way England approached Ireland game .\",\n          \"Labour launched poster claiming the NHS faced a 'Tory cuts plan'\\nThe advert featured an x-ray showing a broken leg of a suspected toddler .\\nMedical experts say it also shows other older injuries to leg and ankle .\\nAppears 'very likely non-accidental injury' and could be result of abuse .\",\n          \"John Watson,  former McLaren driver, was alarmed by race in Melbourne .\\nHe believes the FIA and CVC need to sit down and\\u00a0discuss\\u00a0direction\\u00a0of F1 .\\nOnly 15 cars started the season-opening Australian Grand Prix .\\nWatson fears fans and sponsors are turned off by Mercedes domination .\\nBut he expects McLaren and Honda to recover from difficult starts .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League thanks to a 2-0 win in the first leg, but Tuesday night was supposed to be easy. On Sunday, their place at the top of La Liga was swiped from underneath them, and 92% of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach, according to a recent poll in\\u00a0AS. Most players have been criticised - Cristiano Ronaldo included - but perhaps most under-fire is Iker Casillas. Mr Real Madrid, with over 500 appearances. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at Real Madrid . Three of Schalke's four goals could have been saved, they said. Casillas needs to leave, they said. At 33 years of age, he may well be past his best, with three European Cups, five league titles and one World Cup tucked safely under his belt. Manchester United's David De Gea has been touted as his possible replacement, and even\\u00a0Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher waded into the debate on Tuesday night. 'Madrid need a new keeper. De Gea wants to win trophies. No brainer,' he wrote on Twitter. De Gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by Roy Keane this week, and may leave United . Keylor Navas is also waiting for his chance at the Bernabeu after joining in the summer . And perhaps he has a point. Manchester United have fallen short of expectations once more, and De Gea will be keen to taste success... where better than the city he was born? He is a Spain international, and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman. But you get the feeling that Real Madrid would not be the same without Casillas. Since 1999, he has been a main-stay at the Bernabeu. At the end of the game on Tuesday night, there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team-mates leave the pitch before thanking the Madrid fans. Casillas would not let his team-mates leave the pitch on Tuesday night before they thanked the supporters . Cristiano Ronaldo was unhappy at his side's performance, but was made to applaud the fans by Casillas . Pointing and pulling, ushering his team-mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters. But still they want rid. For the first goal, he palmed the ball into his bottom corner. For the second, he pushed it into the path of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. For the third, he was rooted to the spot. Success is in Madrid's nature, and their fans aren't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding. That starts at the back... with Casillas. Aside from De Gea's potential arrival, you can't forget the presence of Keylor Navas. Signed from Levante in the summer, he is waiting, willing, wishing for his chance. De Gea is a Spain international and grew up in Madrid, playing for Atletico before moving to Man United . Casillas has had a remarkable career, winning numerous trophies including the 2010 World Cup . But De Gea makes sense. He is 24 years old, and getting better with every game he plays. Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for just shy of \\u00a319million in 2011, United would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave. 'I think David De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment,' Roy Keane told ITV after Monday night's FA Cup clash with Arsenal. The best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world. Maybe Jamie Carragher has called it right again.\",\n          \"With their adorable big round eyes and fluffy white fur, these baby seals are cute enough to melt any heart. The harp seals, aged between two and 10-days-old, roll around in the snow and explore their new surroundings. The adorable scene was captured in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts. Snow cute: With their adorable big round eyes and fluffy white fur, these baby seals are cute enough to melt any heart . Brrrilliant: The harp seals, aged between two and 10-days-old, roll around in the snow and explore their new surroundings . Heart-warming: The images were taken by\\u00a0in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts . The 44-year-old spent three days with the seals when she visited a breeding site earlier this month. Cuylaerts, of Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, says: 'It's truly beautiful to watch the little ones get all cosy on the ice. 'They shuffle around, rest, and start squealing when feeding time comes and they're hungry. 'To be there, in the middle of their habitat, was a really great experience. 'The pups basically fill their days with sleeping, eating and getting fat. They spend their first 12 days feeding on very high fat milk from their mothers.' Photographer Ellen Cuylaerts said: 'It's truly beautiful to watch the little ones get all cosy on the ice' 'The pups basically fill their days with sleeping, eating and getting fat,' said Cuylaerts . Cuylaerts, who visited the seals with her husband Michael, watched as the newborns' coats lost there yellow hue and turned completely white . Cuylaerts said that the biggest threat against the seal population is humans . Having gained the trust of the seals, Cuylaerts was able to get within one metre of the pups by lying flat on her stomach and shuffling slowly towards them. Cuylaerts, who visited the seals with her husband Michael, watched as the newborns' coats lost there yellow hue and turned completely white and fluffy over the course of two days. The fur of the harp seal, a species native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean, is a highly valued commodity, and animal rights groups continue to campaign against hunters who target seals. Hunted: The fur of the harp seal, a species native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean, is a highly valued commodity . Cuylaerts was able to get within one metre of the pups by lying flat on her stomach and shuffling slowly towards them . Animal rights groups continue to campaign against hunters who target seals . Loll: The seals love resting on their backs in their icy home . Bliss: This seal looks totally content as it basks in the sun . Adorable: This seal fixes Cuylaerts with its big brown eyes . Cuylaerts says: 'For the harp seal, the biggest threat against their population is humans as the clubbing of seals is still happening. 'When the pups are aged between one and twelve-days old, they cannot be killed but, after the seal's fur starts to molt, the hunt is on. 'The seals are defenceless, not able to swim away or get away! It is cruel and unnecessary.'\",\n          \"Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters. And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (\\u00a31.74million). The Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Hook and Snow White, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper. Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Calgary, British Columbia, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million . Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago . Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods . Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears . The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements. They'll also be the proud holder of British Columbia's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky. And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Calgary, 275 miles away. However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea, \\u00a0the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake. Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of British Columbia, soaring 50 feet into the sky . Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Doris Needham . Enchanting: Doris was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest . For sale: It was bought in 1990 by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers, who have now decided it is time to retire . Continue: But Rocky has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction . The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Doris and Ernest Needham, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House. Indeed, it was Doris' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in the Cedar Mountains. Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by\\u00a0Rocky and Juliet Ehlers. The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement. Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world . Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year . Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world . Rocky, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review: \\u00a0'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.' He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. Estate agent Steve Daschuk said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Canada and internationally. 'We've even had people get in touch from China, enquiring about the forest.' And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year. It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Manhattan, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central London and Hong Kong. Dragons: Estate agent\\u00a0Steve Daschuk described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from China had expressed interest . Remote: The nearest large town is Calgary - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

approach, according to a recent poll in as. most players have been criticised cristiano ronaldo included but perhaps most underfire is iker casillas. mr real madrid, with over 500 appearances. real madrid goalkeeper iker casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances . manchester united goalkeeper david de gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at real madrid . three of schalkes four goals could have been saved, they said. casillas needs to leave, they said. at 33 years of age, he may well be past his best, with three european cups, five league titles and one world cup tucked safely under his belt. manchester uniteds david de gea has been touted as his possible replacement, and even sportsmails jamie carragher waded into the debate on tuesday night. madrid need a new keeper. de gea wants to win trophies. no brainer, he wrote on twitter. de gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by roy keane this week, and may leave united . keylor navas is also waiting for his chance at the bernabeu after joining in the summer . and perhaps he has a point. manchester united have fallen short of expectations once more, and de gea will be keen to taste success... where better than the city he was born? he is a spain international, and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman. but you get the feeling that real madrid would not be the same without casillas. since 1999, he has been a mainstay at the bernabeu. at the end of the game on tuesday night, there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his teammates leave the pitch before thanking the madrid fans. casillas would not let his teammates leave the pitch on tuesday night before they thanked the supporters . cristiano ronaldo was unhappy at his sides performance, but was made to applaud the fans by casillas . pointing and pulling, ushering his teammates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters. but still they want rid. for the first goal, he palmed the ball into his bottom corner. for the second, he pushed it into the path of klaasjan huntelaar. for the third, he was rooted to the spot. success is in madrids nature, and their fans arent happy with the amount of goals they are conceding. that starts at the back... with casillas. aside from de geas potential arrival, you cant forget the presence of keylor navas. signed from levante in the summer, he is waiting, willing, wishing for his chance. de gea is a spain international and grew up in madrid, playing for atletico before moving to man united . casillas has had a remarkable career, winning numerous trophies including the 2010 world cup . but de gea makes sense. he is 24 years old, and getting better with every game he plays. signed by sir alex ferguson for just shy of 19million in 2011, united would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave. i think david de gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment, roy keane told itv after monday nights fa cup clash with arsenal. the best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world. maybe jamie carragher has called it right again.\",\n          \"with their adorable
